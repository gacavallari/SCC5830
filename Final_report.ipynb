    "Facial recognition is being used in many systems and applications. In some cases it's important to detect if fake images are being uploaded by the user to the system in a registration process. This project aims to detect \"photoshopped\" frontal face images. The goal of this project is to detect likely regions that have been modified using photo editing tools.\n",
